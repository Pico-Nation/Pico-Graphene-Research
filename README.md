# Pico-Dev-Graphene-Setup v1.0

This repo contains all the scripts needed for Pico Devs to get started. These scripts will download and install all the libraries and  dependencies that are required to test and develop graphene blockchain code. This makes it easier to get started working with graphene and takes all of the guess work out of the normal setup.                      

## Getting Started with Graphene-UI

In order to use this script just download or clone it to the directory you want to use as your graphene environment.

## Prerequisites

In order to be able to run this script after the download is complete the user must use the following command to make the script executable.

```
sudo chmod +x Graphene-ui-Setup
```

## Installing

Now to run the script open up the command line (cmd) and run the following command.

```
./Graphene-ui-Setup
```

Once the script is running it will take awhile for everything to be installed. Do not stop the script intill it is done! 

## OS Tested On
